# Image Segmentation and Inpainting Experiment

This project is an experimental exploration of browser-based image segmentation using TransformerJS and inpainting using LaMa (Large Mask Inpainting).

## Overview

The experiment combines two main components:

1. Browser-based image segmentation using TransformerJS
2. Image inpainting using LaMa, run on Google Colab as a backend service

## Key Features

- Interactive image segmentation in the browser
- Object removal and inpainting
- Real-time visualization of segmentation results

## Limitations and Observations

### Segmentation Challenges

The TransformerJS-based segmentation sometimes struggles with complex objects, particularly those with distinct sections that have different visual characteristics. For example:

- A car might be segmented into separate parts (body, wheels, windows) instead of being recognized as a single object.
- Animals with distinct fur patterns or color variations might be incorrectly segmented.

These limitations highlight the complexity of image understanding and the ongoing challenges in developing more robust segmentation algorithms.

### Inpainting Artifacts

The LaMa inpainting model, while powerful, can sometimes produce unexpected results:

- Introduction of new objects: In some cases, the inpainting process may introduce objects that weren't present in the original image. This can happen when the model attempts to fill large or complex masked areas.
- Inconsistent textures: The inpainted areas may not always perfectly match the surrounding textures, especially in images with intricate patterns or lighting conditions.
- Edge artifacts: There might be visible seams or inconsistencies at the edges of inpainted regions, particularly when removing objects that cast shadows or have complex interactions with their surroundings.

These artifacts underscore the challenges of creating realistic and contextually appropriate image completions, especially without user guidance.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced segmentation models to improve accuracy on complex objects
- Explore user-guided segmentation to overcome limitations in automatic detection
- Investigate techniques to refine inpainting results, possibly incorporating user input or multiple inpainting passes
- Optimize performance for larger images and more complex scenes
